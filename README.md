    :so ~/.vimrc

## Configuration

[html indentation](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2075)
provided by Andy Wokula is faster. But you need to make some configuration.

Suggested configuration:

```vim
let g:html_indent_inctags = "html,body,head,tbody"
let g:html_indent_script1 = "inc"
let g:html_indent_style1 = "inc"
```
